    <string name="news_content">After his airport look, both
        Kohli and Anushka were spotted at Nesco in Mumbai attending\
        kirtan by American vocalist Krishna Das. This couple was photographed
        seated in the front row, enjoying the show. Whereas Anushka was captured
        clapping with the audience, Kohli had a smile of joy throughout the event.
        \n\nThis simple airport stopover came after a poor show by Kohli during
        India’s first test against New Zealand, where he was dismissed for a
        nine-ball duck in India’s first inning. India’s team lost the match
        by eight wickets, and most of the players left for Pune, where the second \
        Test was due to start on October 24. On the other hand, Kohli decided to make the
        \most of his time with his family and only left for Mumbai.</string>
